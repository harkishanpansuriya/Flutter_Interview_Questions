## How does Flutter run the code on Android?

- The engine's C and C++ code are compiled with Android's NDK. The Dart code (both the SDK's and
  yours) are ahead-of-time (AOT) compiled into native, ARM, and x86-64 libraries. Those libraries
  are included in a "runner" Android project, and the whole thing is built into an .apk. When
  launched, the app loads the Flutter library. Any rendering, input, or event handling, and so on,
  is delegated to the compiled Flutter and app code. This is similar to the way many game engines
  work.

During debug mode, Flutter uses a virtual machine (VM) to run its code in order to enable stateful
hot reload, a feature that lets you make changes to your running code without recompilation. You'll
see a "debug" banner in the top right-hand corner of your app when running in this mode, to remind
you that performance is not characteristic of the finished release app.

## How does Flutter run the code on iOS?

- The engine's C and C++ code are compiled with LLVM. The Dart code (both the SDK's and yours) are
  ahead-of-time (AOT) compiled into a native, ARM library. That library is included in a "runner"
  iOS project, and the whole thing is built into an .ipa. When launched, the app loads the Flutter
