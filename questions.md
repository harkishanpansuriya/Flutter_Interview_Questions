# ðŸš€ Flutter Interview Questions and Answers ðŸ’¡

# Flutter Overview and Key Concepts

## 1. What is Flutter, How does it work? and is Flutter a language?

**Flutter** is a free, open-source software development kit (SDK) for building cross-platform mobile
applications. Created by Google and released in May 2017, Flutter is built using C, C++, Skia (2D
rendering engine), and Dart, an object-oriented language.

- Flutter is an open source framework developed and supported by Google. Frontend and full-stack
  developers use Flutter to build an application's user interface (UI) for multiple platforms with a
  single codebase.

- However, Flutter is not a programming language. It's a SDK.

## 2. Flutter Inspector

The **Flutter Inspector** is a powerful tool for Flutter applications, allowing you to visualize the
blueprint of your widgets and their properties. It helps diagnose layout issues and understand the
current layout.

### Features of Flutter Inspector:

- Select widget mode
- Toggle platform
- Show paint baselines
- Show debug paint
- Refresh widget
- Enable slow animations
- Show/hide performance overlay

## 3. Advantages of Flutter:

- Flexible and Expressive UI: Flutterâ€™s layered architecture allows for highly customizable and
  expressive UIs with smooth animations and fast rendering.
- Faster Development:
  The "hot reload" feature enables developers to see changes instantly without losing the app's
  state, speeding up development significantly.
- Single Codebase: Flutter allows developers to write a single codebase for both Android and iOS
  apps, reducing development time and effort.
- Native Performance: Flutter compiles to native ARM code, providing near-native performance on both
  Android and iOS platforms.
- Rich Widget Library: Flutter offers a wide range of customizable widgets, making it easy to create
  complex UIs.
- Strong Community Support: Flutter has a large and active community of developers, providing
  resources, plugins, and support.

## 4. Features of Flutter:

- Flexibility, scalability, and integration
- Hot reload
- One-stop solution for development
- Native performance with internationalized Flutter libraries
- Extensive widget library

## 5. Limitations of Flutter:

- Large App Size: Flutter apps generally have a larger size compared to native apps due to the
  inclusion of the Flutter engine and framework libraries.
- Limited Access to Platform-Specific APIs: While Flutter provides plugins for common
  platform-specific features (e.g., camera, GPS, sensors), accessing less common or advanced native
  APIs can require writing custom platform-specific code using Platform Channels. This can add
  complexity and require knowledge of the native platform languages (Kotlin/Java for Android,
  Swift/Objective-C for iOS).
- Performance Limitations for Highly Complex Animations: Flutter provides great performance for most
  use cases, but apps with highly complex 3D animations, advanced graphics, or AR/VR may not perform
  as well as native implementations. For 3D-heavy apps, game engines like Unity or Unreal Engine
  might be more suitable.
- Limited Libraries and Plugins: While Flutter has a rich set of widgets and plugins, it may not
  have as extensive a library ecosystem as native platforms like Android or iOS. Developers may need
  to write custom plugins or workarounds for specific features.

## 6. What is Dart?

**Dart** is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language with C-style syntax. Open-source
and developed by Google in 2011, Dart is designed for creating frontend user interfaces for web and
mobile apps. It is integral to Flutter development and supports both AOT (Ahead-of-Time) and JIT (
Just-in-Time) compilation.

## 7. Explain Flutter SDK and Role of SDK in Flutter:

- The Flutter SDK (Software Development Kit) is a set of tools and libraries that enables developers
  to create applications using the Flutter framework. It provides everything needed to build, test,
  and deploy Flutter apps across different platforms like iOS, Android, web, and desktop.

The Flutter SDK provides tools, libraries, and resources to create user interfaces for Android and
iOS using a single codebase.

### Key Features of Flutter SDK:

- Dart SDK
- Rendering engine, widgets, APIs for testing and integration
- Compilation tools for native machine code (iOS and Android)
- React-style modern framework
- Interop and plugin APIs to connect with system and third-party SDKs
- Headless test runner for Windows, Linux, and Mac
- Dart DevTools for testing, debugging, and profiling
- Flutter and Dart command-line tools for development, building, testing, and compiling across
  platforms

## 8. Why Flutter Uses Dart:

- Dart is declarative and programmatic, making it easy to read and visualize
- No need for a separate declarative layout language (like XML or JSX)
- Faster than JavaScript with AOT and JIT compilation
- JIT compilation for development and AOT for production

### Development Time Considerations:

- Generating device-specific IPA or APK files takes time
- Building a Flutter application uses Xcode and Gradle, which are time-consuming processes

## 9. Full Form of API:

**API:** Application Programming Interface

## 10. Difference Between Package and Plugin in Flutter:

- **Package:** Contains only Dart code.
- **Plugin:** A special kind of package that includes native Kotlin/Java (for Android) or
  Swift/Objective-C (for iOS) code.

### Examples:

#### Package:

- `http`: API for making HTTP requests from a Flutter app.
- `shared_preferences`: Store and retrieve key-value pairs in persistent storage.
- `intl`: Internationalization and localization support.

#### Plugin: (You need a plugin when you need to communicate with native OS.)

- `camera`: Access the device's camera, take pictures, and record videos.
- `firebase_messaging`: Receive and handle push notifications using Firebase Cloud Messaging.
- `google_maps_flutter`: Display interactive maps using the Google Maps API.

## 11. Dart Compilation Modes: AOT and JIT

### JIT (Just-in-Time) Compilation:

- Slower startup time
- Better peak performance
- Compiles code at runtime
- Offers debugging tools and hot reload
- Suited for development and testing
- Uses more memory but allows quicker iteration

### AOT (Ahead-of-Time) Compilation:

- Faster startup times
- Consistent performance
- Compiles code before runtime
- Lacks debugging tools
- Designed for production
- Smaller binary sizes, conserving memory

### Additional Notes:

- JIT-compiled code may have superior peak performance but slower startup.
- AOT-compiled code prioritizes fast startup and lower memory usage.
- JIT is easier to debug due to runtime state access.
- AOT code is smaller because it excludes the JIT compiler.

## 12. Flutter Widgets:

- Widgets are the basic components that define your appâ€™s UI. They determine how things look and
  behave, and whenever the appâ€™s state changes, Flutter updates the widget tree to reflect those
  changes in the UI.

The layers of a Flutter app created by "flutter create": Dart app, framework, engine, embedder,
runner
Dart App

Composes widgets into the desired UI.
Implements business logic.
Owned by app developer.
Framework (source code)

Provides higher-level API to build high-quality apps (for example, widgets, hit-testing, gesture
detection, accessibility, text input).
Composites the app's widget tree into a scene.
Engine (source code)

Responsible for rasterizing composited scenes.
Provides low-level implementation of Flutter's core APIs (for example, graphics, text layout, Dart
runtime).
Exposes its functionality to the framework using the dart:ui API.
Integrates with a specific platform using the Engine's Embedder API.
Embedder (source code)

Coordinates with the underlying operating system for access to services like rendering surfaces,
accessibility, and input.
Manages the event loop.
Exposes platform-specific API to integrate the Embedder into apps.
Runner

Composes the pieces exposed by the platform-specific API of the Embedder into an app package
runnable on the target platform.
Part of app template generated by flutter create, owned by app developer.

## 9. Flutter architecture

![img_2.png](img_2.png)

## Framework Layer (Dart)

- This is the part of Flutter where developers work to build their apps.
- It helps you compose widgets to design the UI and implement the appâ€™s business logic.
- It provides higher-level tools like widgets, gesture detection, accessibility, and text input.
- This layer also takes the appâ€™s widget tree and prepares it to be rendered on the screen.

## Engine Layer (C, C++)

- This is the core part of Flutter responsible for rendering the app onto the screen.
- It handles tasks like graphics rendering, text layout, and running Dart code.
- The `dart:ui` API is used to connect this layer with the framework.
- The engine is built using C and C++ and relies on the Skia graphics library for rendering.

## Embedder Layer (Platform-Specific Code)

- This layer connects Flutter to the operating system (like Android, iOS, Windows, etc.).
- It handles tasks like managing input (touch, keyboard), rendering surfaces, and accessibility.
- It also manages the event loop and enables communication between Flutter and native APIs.

## 10. Interface in Dart

Dart does not have an `interface` keyword. Instead, you can achieve interface-like behavior using
the `abstract` keyword.

```dart
abstract class Animal {
  void makeSound();
}

class Dog implements Animal {
  @override
  void makeSound() {
    print("Bark");
  }
}

void main() {
  Dog dog = Dog();
  dog.makeSound(); // Output: Bark
}
```

## 11. GraphQL vs REST

### GraphQL

- API query language and runtime for answering queries with existing data.
- Request and receive specific data.
- Provides all data in one endpoint.

**Pros:**

- Efficient data fetching
- Flexible and scalable

**Cons:**

- Requires a learning curve
- Overhead of setting up GraphQL server

### RESTful

- Uses a set of endpoints responding to specific HTTP requests.
- Presents data in XML and YAML formats.
- Rigid endpoints and data structures.

**Pros:**

- Simple and widely used
- Easy to cache

**Cons:**

- Over-fetching or under-fetching of data
- Less flexible in terms of data querying

## 12. What is an Extension?

Extensions add new methods to existing classes or interfaces without changing their original
implementation.

```dart
extension NumberParsing on String {
  int toInt() {
    return int.parse(this);
  }
}

void main() {
  print("123".toInt()); // Output: 123
}
```

## 13. Dart â€“ Standard Input and Output

### Input

In Dart, you can take standard input from the user via the `stdin.readLineSync()` function. You need
to import the `dart:io` library.

```dart
import 'dart:io';

void main() {
  print("Enter your name:");
  String? name = stdin.readLineSync();
  print("Hello, $name!");
}
```

### Output

Use the `print` statement or `stdout.write()` method to display output in the console.

```dart
void main() {
  // Printing using print statement
  print("Welcome!");

  // Printing using stdout.write
  stdout.write("Welcome again!");
}
```

## 14. What is the `late` keyword used for?

The `late` keyword in Dart is used to declare a non-nullable variable that will be initialized
later. It supports lazy initialization of variables and throws a `LateInitializationError` if the
variable is used before being initialized.

```dart
late String description;

void main() {
  description = "This is a late variable";
  print(description);
}
```

## 15. What is Generic in Dart?

Generics in Dart allow you to create reusable functions, classes, and types that can work with
multiple data types, while still providing type safety.

```dart
class Dropdown<T> {
  final List<T> items;

  Dropdown(this.items);
}

// Using the generic class
void main() {
  Dropdown<String> stringDropdown = Dropdown(['Apple', 'Banana', 'Cherry']);
  Dropdown<int> intDropdown = Dropdown([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);
}
```

Generics ensure that you cannot add a string to an `intDropdown` or vice versa, providing type
safety and reusability.

# Dart and Flutter Key Concepts

## 15. What is `Expanded` and `Flexible` in Dart?

### Expanded

- **Definition:** A widget that expands a child of a Row, Column, or Flex so that the child fills
  the available space.
- **Usage:** Makes a child of a Row, Column, or Flex expand to fill the available space along the
  main axis (horizontally for a Row or vertically for a Column).

### Flexible

- **Definition:** Gives a child of a Row, Column, or Flex the flexibility to expand to fill the
  available space in the main axis, but does not require the child to fill the available space.
- **Difference from Expanded:** Unlike Expanded, Flexible does not force the child to occupy all
  available space.

```dart
class MyWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyWidget({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Row
      (
      children: [
        Expanded(
          child: Container(
            color: Colors.red,
            child: Text('Expanded'),
          ),
        ),
        Flexible(
          child: Container(
            color: Colors.green,
            child: Text('Flexible'),
          ),
        )
        ,
      ]
      ,
    );
  }
}

```

## 16. Flex Widget in Dart

- **Definition:** A widget that displays its children in a one-dimensional array, either
  horizontally or vertically, similar to a Row or Column widget.

```dart
class MyWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyWidget({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Flex
      (
      direction: Axis.horizontal, // or Axis.vertical
      children: [
        Container(
          width: 100,
          height: 100,
          color: Colors.red,
        ),
        Container(
          width: 200,
          height: 100,
          color: Colors.green,
        ),
        Container(
          width: 50,
          height: 100,
          color: Colors.blue,
        )
        ,
      ]
      ,
    );
  }
}

```

## 17. `didChangeDependencies` vs `didUpdateWidget`

### didChangeDependencies

- **When Called:** Called when a dependency of the State object changes, such as when an
  InheritedWidget that the widget depends on changes.
- **Usage:** Called immediately after `initState()` and whenever a dependency changes. Useful for
  performing expensive operations when dependencies change.

### didUpdateWidget

- **When Called:** Called whenever the widget configuration changes, such as when the parent widget
  passes new data to the child widget.
- **Usage:** Called whenever the widget's configuration changes. Useful for updating the widget's UI
  in response to changes in the widget's configuration.

```dart
class MyWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyWidgetState createState() => _MyWidgetState();
}

class _MyWidgetState extends State<MyWidget> {
  @override
  void didChangeDependencies() {
    super.didChangeDependencies();
    // Handle dependency changes
  }

  @override
  void didUpdateWidget(MyWidget oldWidget) {
    super.didUpdateWidget(oldWidget);
    // Handle widget configuration changes
  }
}
```

## 18. What Does `context.mounted = false` Mean?

- **Definition:** Indicates that the widget is no longer part of the widget tree and has been
  disposed or removed.

## 19. What is `as` and `is` in Dart?

### `as` Keyword

- **Usage:** Used for type casting, converting an object of one type to another type.

```dart

var obj = 'Hello';
String str = obj as String;
```

### `is` Keyword

- **Usage:** Used for type checking, checking if an object is of a specific type and returns a
  boolean.

```dart
void main() {
  var obj = 'Hello';
  if (obj is String) {
    print('obj is a String');
  }
}
```

# Dart and Flutter Key Concepts

## 15. What is state and Why We Use State Management Instead of `setState`?

### State in Flutter:

- In Flutter, state refers to the information or data that determines how a widget looks or behaves
  at any given time. When this data changes, the widget rebuilds to reflect the new state.
- In simple terms, The state is what your app "remembers" to show the correct UI. For example, if a
  button is clicked, the state updates, and the UI changes based on that updated state.

### Using `setState`

- **Definition:** Directly updates the state of a widget and rebuilds the entire widget tree.
- **Drawback:** Inefficient for large trees, as it causes the entire widget tree to rebuild, even if
  only one widget's state has changed.

### Using State Management

- **Definition:** Solutions like `Provider`, `Riverpod`, or `Bloc` decouple widgets from the app's
  state.
- **Advantage:** Only the widgets that need to be updated are rebuilt, leading to more efficient and
  manageable code.

## 16. `var` and `dynamic` in Dart

### `dynamic`

- **Definition:** Can change both the type and value of the variable.
- **Example:**

```dart
void main() {
  dynamic variable = 'Hello';
  variable = 42; // No error
}
```

### `var`

- **Definition:** The type of the variable is inferred at compile-time and cannot be changed, but
  the value can be changed.
- **Example:**

```dart
void main() {
  var variable = 'Hello';
// variable = 42; // Error: A value of type 'int' can't be assigned to a variable of type 'String'.
  variable = 'World'; // No error
}
```

## 17. Difference Between Calling `Future` and `Future.microtask` in Flutter

### `Future`

- **Definition:** Executes after all microtasks are completed.
- **Example:**

```dart
void main() {
  Future(() => print('future 1'));
  Future(() => print('future 2'));
  // Output: "future 1" then "future 2"
}
```

### `Future.microtask`

- **Definition:** Executes before any other Futures/Timers, useful for completing small computations
  asynchronously as soon as possible.
- **Example:**

```dart
void main() {
  Future(() => print('future 1'));
  Future(() => print('future 2'));
  Future.microtask(() => print('microtask 1'));
  Future.microtask(() => print('microtask 2'));
  // Output: "microtask 1", "microtask 2", "future 1", "future 2"
}
```

## 18. `is` and `as` Keywords in Dart

### `as` Keyword

- **Usage:** Used for type casting, converting an object to a specific type.
- **Example:**

```dart
void main() {
  Object obj = 'Hello, World!';
  String str = obj as String;
  print(str); // Output: "Hello, World!"
}
```

### `is` Keyword

- **Usage:** Used for type checking, returning a boolean value indicating if the object is of the
  specified type.
- **Example:**

```dart
void main() {
  Object obj = 'Hello, World!';
  if (obj is String) {
    print('obj is a String'); // Output: "obj is a String"
  } else {
    print('obj is not a String');
  }
}
```

## 19. Queues in Dart

### Definition

- **Definition:** A FIFO (First In, First Out) data structure where the first element added is the
  first one removed.
- **Usage:** Useful for building collections of data that need to be processed in the order they
  were added.

### Example

```dart
import 'dart:collection';

void main() {
  // Creating a Queue
  Queue<String> queue = Queue<String>();

  // Adding elements
  queue.add("Geeks");
  queue.addAll(["For", "Geeks"]);
  print(queue); // Output: {Geeks, For, Geeks}

  // Checking if the queue is empty
  print(queue.isEmpty); // Output: false

  // Adding first and last elements
  queue.addFirst("First");
  queue.addLast("Last");
  print(queue); // Output: {First, Geeks, For, Geeks, Last}

  // Removing first and last elements
  queue.removeFirst();
  queue.removeLast();
  print(queue); // Output: {Geeks, For, Geeks}

  // Displaying all elements
  queue.forEach(print); // Output: Geeks For Geeks
}
```

## 21. Routes vs Route Generator in Flutter

### Routes

- **Definition:** Static map of route names to widgets.
- **Limitation:** Cannot pass arguments to widgets or implement custom `PageRoute`.

### Route Generator

- **Definition:** Dynamically generates routes, allowing for passing arguments and implementing
  custom navigation logic.
- **Usage:** Implemented using the `onGenerateRoute` property of `MaterialApp`.

#### Example

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(
    MaterialApp(
      routes: {
        '/': (_) => HomePage(),
        '/foo': (_) => FooPage(),
      },
      onGenerateRoute: (settings) {
        if (settings.name == '/bar') {
          final value = settings.arguments as int;
          return MaterialPageRoute(builder: (_) => BarPage(value));
        }
        return null;
      },
    ),
  );
}
```

### HomePage

```dart
class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('HomePage')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          children: [
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () => Navigator.pushNamed(context, '/foo'),
              child: Text('Go to FooPage'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () => Navigator.pushNamed(context, '/bar', arguments: 42),
              child: Text('Go to BarPage'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### FooPage

```dart
class FooPage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(_) => Scaffold(appBar: AppBar(title: Text('FooPage')));
}
```

### BarPage

```dart
class BarPage extends StatelessWidget {
  final int value;

  BarPage(this.value);

  @override
  Widget build(_) => Scaffold(appBar: AppBar(title: Text('BarPage, value = $value')));
}
```

## 22. Push vs PushNamed Methods

### push

- **Definition:** Requires a `Route` object.
- **Usage:** Used for navigating to routes dynamically created at runtime.

### pushNamed

- **Definition:** Requires a `String` argument, the name of the route.
- **Usage:** Used for navigating to routes defined in the `routes` map or `onGenerateRoute`.

## 23. Enum in Dart

### Definition

- **Definition:** Special kind of class used to represent a fixed number of constant values.
- **Usage:** Makes the code easier to read and maintain by giving names to constants.

### Example

```dart
enum Status { active, inactive, pending }

void main() {
  Status currentStatus = Status.active;

  switch (currentStatus) {
    case Status.active:
      print('The status is active');
      break;
    case Status.inactive:
      print('The status is inactive');
      break;
    case Status.pending:
      print('The status is pending');
      break;
  }
}
```

## 24. Casting in Dart

### Definition

- **Definition:** Convert an object of one type to another.
- **Explicit Cast:** Uses the `as` keyword.
- **Implicit Cast:** Automatically converts types if safe.

### Example

#### Explicit Cast

```dart
void main() {
  Object x = 12;
  int y = x as int; // explicit cast from Object to int
  print(y.runtimeType); // prints: int
}
```

#### Implicit Cast

```dart
void main() {
  int integer = 10;
  double doubleValue = integer.toDouble();
  print(doubleValue); // Output: 10.0
}
```

## 25. Implicit Interface in Dart

### Definition

- **Definition:** Defined using abstract classes.
- **Usage:** Any class extending the abstract class must implement all its abstract methods.

### Example

```dart
abstract class Printable {
  void print();
}

class Document implements Printable {
  @override
  void print() {
    print('Printing a document...');
  }
}

class Image implements Printable {
  @override
  void print() {
    print('Printing an image...');
  }
}
```

## 26. `assert` in Dart

### Definition

- **Definition:** Debugging tool used to verify assumptions about the state of the program during
  development.
- **Usage:** Takes a boolean expression; if false, throws an `AssertionError`.

### Example

```dart
void greet(String name) {
  assert(name != null, "Name cannot be null");
  print("Hello, $name!");
}

void main() {
  greet("Alice"); // Assertion passes, "Hello, Alice!" is printed
  greet(null); // Assertion fails, throws AssertionError with message
}
```

## 27. Final vs const in Dart

### Final

- **Definition:** Variable can only be set once and is initialized when accessed.

### Const

- **Definition:** Compile-time constant, value must be known before runtime.

## 28. Why do we required mixin and what Mixin in Dart

### we required mixin because Dart does not support multiple inheritances. Therefore for implementing multiple inheritances in Flutter. We require mixins. Mixins offer a way for writing reusable class code in multiple class hierarchies.

### Definition

- **Definition:** Reuse code in multiple classes.
- **Usage:** Declared using the `mixin` keyword, combined with classes using `with`.

### Example

#### Using `on` keyword

```dart
class Musician {
  musicianMethod() {
    print('Playing music!');
  }
}

mixin MusicalPerformer on Musician {
  performerMethod() {
    print('Performing music!');
    super.musicianMethod();
  }
}

class SingerDancer extends Musician with MusicalPerformer {}

main() {
  SingerDancer().performerMethod();
}
```

#### Using `with` keyword

```dart
mixin Musician {
  void playInstrument(String instrumentName);

  void playPiano() {
    playInstrument('Piano');
  }

  void playFlute() {
    playInstrument('Flute');
  }
}

class Virtuoso with Musician {
  void playInstrument(String instrumentName) {
    print('Plays the $instrumentName beautifully');
  }
}
```

## 13. Spacer in Dart

### Definition

- **Spacer:** A widget in Flutter that takes up available space in a `Row`, `Column`, or `Flex`
  layout.

### Example

```dart
class MyWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyWidget({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Row
      (
      children: <Widget>[
        Text('Start'),
        Spacer(),
        Text('End'
        )
        ,
      ],
    );
  }
}

```

## 14. Stateful vs Stateless Widget in Flutter

### Stateless Widgets

- **Definition:** Widgets that cannot change their state during the runtime of the app.
- **State:** Immutable.
- **Lifecycle Method:**
    - `build()`: Automatically called when the widget is built.

### Stateful Widgets

- **Definition:** Widgets that can change their state during runtime.
- **State:** Mutable.
- **Lifecycle Methods:**
    1. `createState()`: Returns an instance of the state associated with the widget.
    2. `mounted`: A boolean value that turns true when the `BuildContext` is assigned to the widget.
    3. `initState()`: Called just before the widget is built; initializes variables required by the
       build method.
    4. `didChangeDependencies()`: Called after `initState()`, invoked when the dependencies of the
       state object change.
    5. `build()`: Displays the UI on the screen, returning a widget. Rebuilds when `setState` is
       called.
    6. `didUpdateWidget(Widget oldWidget)`: Called when the widget changes, useful for handling old
       object unsubscription and new object subscription.
    7. `setState()`: Used to update the UI; triggers a rebuild of the widget.
    8. `deactivate()`: Called when the widget is popped but might be reinserted before the current
       frame change is finished.
    9. `dispose()`: Called after the state object is completely removed or when the screen is
       popped; used for cleanup operations.

## 15. What is `setState()`?

- **Definition:** In Flutter, `setState` is a method used to update the state of a `StatefulWidget`.
  It triggers a rebuild of the widget tree, causing the `build` method to re-run and update the UI.

### Example

```dart
void _incrementCounter() {
  setState(() {
    _counter++;
  });
}
```

## 16. `pubspec.yaml` and `pubspec.lock` Files in Flutter

### `pubspec.yaml`

- **Definition:** A configuration file included in every Flutter project, containing metadata about
  the project, dependencies, assets, and other configurations.
- **Usage:** Ensures that the specified packages and versions are used when building the project.

### `pubspec.lock`

- **Definition:** Automatically generated file that locks the specific versions of dependencies used
  in the project.
- **Usage:** Ensures consistency across different environments by locking dependency versions.

## 17. `main()` vs `runApp()` in Flutter

### `main()`

- **Definition:** The entry point of a Dart program, setting up and starting the app.
- **Usage:** Calls `runApp()` to start the Flutter application.

### `runApp()`

- **Definition:** A Flutter-specific method that initializes the app and connects the widget tree to
  the screen.
- **Usage:** Starts the app execution and displays the root widget on the screen.

### Example

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

## 18. Method vs Function

### Method

- **Definition:** An action associated with a class or an object.
- **Usage:** Called using dot notation (e.g., `object.method()`).
- **Purpose:** Can modify the state of an object.

### Function

- **Definition:** An independent unit of code not associated with a class.
- **Usage:** Called using the function name (e.g., `function()`).
- **Purpose:** Cannot modify the state of an object.

## 19. Types of Keys in Flutter

### Types of Keys

- **ValueKey:**
    - A `ValueKey` is used when you want to assign a key based on a specific value. This value could
      be a `String`, `int`, or any other type that can be compared for equality. It helps Flutter
      identify widgets when rebuilding the widget tree.
    - **Example Usage:** Typically used when the widget's identity depends on a value, such as a
      list item or any widget that changes based on a dynamic value.

    ```dart
    ValueKey(myValue);
    ```

- **ObjectKey:**
    - An `ObjectKey` is based on the identity of an object. This key works by comparing the memory
      location of an object, making it useful when you need to distinguish between different
      instances of objects that might contain the same data.
    - **Example Usage:** Used when you want to differentiate between different instances of the same
      type of object (e.g., comparing two different instances of a class).

    ```dart
    ObjectKey(myObject);
    ```

- **UniqueKey:**
    - A `UniqueKey` generates a unique identifier for each widget. This key is particularly useful
      when you need to create new widget instances that are guaranteed to be distinct, such as
      dynamically created widgets.
    - **Example Usage:** Useful for cases where you want to ensure that every widget gets a unique
      identity, especially when adding/removing widgets frequently.

    ```dart
    UniqueKey();
    ```

- **GlobalKey:**
    - A `GlobalKey` is a special type of key that allows you to access the state of a widget from
      anywhere in the app. This is helpful when you need to reference a specific widget outside of
      its context, such as manipulating form fields or accessing the widget's state globally.
    - **Example Usage:** Often used in cases like forms or when you need to access a stateful
      widget's state from other parts of the app.

    ```dart
    GlobalKey<FormState>();
    ```

### Usage Scenarios

- **Lists and Grids:**
    - Keys are essential in lists or grids to ensure the correct state is maintained when the order
      or content of the list changes. Without keys, Flutter might incorrectly rebuild items or lose
      the state.
    - **Example:** If a list item is reordered, the `ValueKey` helps Flutter identify the correct
      widget and maintain its state.

- **Form Inputs:**
    - When dealing with forms, keys are used to preserve user input during widget rebuilds, ensuring
      the input is not lost during state changes or widget reordering.
    - **Example:** A `GlobalKey<FormState>` can be used to validate form fields or access the form's
      state outside the form widget.

- **Animation Transitions:**
    - When animating transitions between different widgets, keys are important to ensure that
      Flutter can identify which widgets need to be animated.
    - **Example:** Using `ValueKey` or `ObjectKey` can ensure that Flutter animates the correct
      widget in a list or grid during changes.

- **Stateful Widgets:**
    - Keys are particularly useful with stateful widgets. By using keys, you can ensure that a
      widget maintains its state even if its position changes in the widget tree.
    - **Example:** A `GlobalKey` can be used to access and manipulate the state of a specific
      stateful widget from anywhere in the app.

- **Accessing Specific Widgets:**
    - A `GlobalKey` allows you to control specific widgets or access their state from anywhere in
      the app. This is especially useful when you need to programmatically manipulate widgets, such
      as showing a dialog or updating a form's state from a distant part of the app.
    - **Example:** Using a `GlobalKey<ScaffoldState>` to open or close a drawer from outside the
      `Scaffold`.

## 20. Future.wait in Dart

### Definition

- **Future.wait():** Allows waiting for multiple Future objects to complete. Takes a list of Future
  objects and returns a new Future that completes when all input Futures complete.

### Example

```dart
Future<void> fetchData() async {
  await Future.wait([
    fetchUser(),
    fetchPosts(),
  ]);
}
```

## 21. Flutter Hot Reload

### Definition

- **Hot Reload:** Enables developers to see changes made to the code almost instantly on the app
  screen.
- **Benefit:** Allows fixing bugs quickly and seeing results without restarting the app, resulting
  in faster development cycles.

### How it Works

- **Mechanism:** Injects updated source code files into the running Dart Virtual Machine (VM). The
  VM updates classes, and the Flutter framework rebuilds the widget tree.

## 22. Structure of a Flutter App

### Components

1. **MaterialApp:**
    - **Definition:** Blueprint for the app, setting the overall theme and structure.
    - **Usage:** Starting point, indicating usage of Material components and design.

2. **Scaffold:**
    - **Definition:** Basic layout structure of the screen, including the AppBar and body.
    - **Usage:** Used to create a consistent visual structure.

3. **Widgets:**
    - **Definition:** Building blocks of the app, such as buttons, text, images, etc.
    - **Usage:** Create the UI by combining various widgets.

## 23. Difference Between Set and List

### Set

- **Definition:** Collection of unique elements.
- **Order:** Unordered.

### List

- **Definition:** Collection of elements that can include duplicates.
- **Order:** Ordered in the sequence they were added.

### Example

```dart

Set<int> mySet = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5}; // Duplicate 5 will be removed
List<int> myList = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5]; // Duplicate 5 will remain
```

## 24. Stream and Future in Dart

#### **Stream**

- **Purpose:** Delivers **multiple values** or events over time (e.g., real-time updates).
- **Types:**
    - **Single-subscription:** One listener at a time.
    - **Broadcast:** Multiple listeners can subscribe.

#### **Future**

- **Purpose:** Delivers **one value** (or error) when an asynchronous operation finishes (e.g.,
  network requests).
- **Features:**
    - `Future.value()`: Provides a predefined value.
    - `Future.error()`: Provides an error.
    - `.then()`: Runs when completed successfully.
    - `.catchError()`: Runs when an error occurs.

#### **Key Differences**

- **Stream:** Many values over time, like a video stream, chat messages, etc.
- **Future:** One result, like downloading a file, fetching data, etc.

## 25. What is a List?

- **Definition:** A collection of objects that can include duplicates and maintains order.

## 26. What is a HashMap?

- **Definition:** An unordered collection of key-value pairs based on a hashtable. Keys must be
  unique objects.
- In summary, a HashMap is an efficient, unordered collection in Dart that allows for quick access
  to values using unique keys, making it ideal for many use cases where fast lookups are required.

## 27. What is a Set?

- **Definition:** A collection of unique elements; no duplicates allowed.

## 28. What is an Iterable?

- **Definition:** A collection of elements that can be accessed sequentially.
- **Usage:** Abstract class; can be instantiated by creating a List or Set.

### 29. Difference Between `Future` and `Future.microtask` in Flutter

#### `Future`

- **Definition:** Represents a delayed computation or a result that will be available sometime in
  the future.
- **Execution:** Scheduled in the event loop and executed after microtasks.

#### `Future.microtask`

- **Definition:** Represents a microtask, which is a small unit of work that completes immediately
  after the current event loop iteration.
- **Execution:** Executed before any other `Future` or `Timer` callbacks in the event loop.

### Example

```dart
void main() {
  Future(() => print('future 1'));
  Future(() => print('future 2'));

  // Microtasks will be executed before futures.
  Future.microtask(() => print('microtask 1'));
  Future.microtask(() => print('microtask 2'));
}
```

### Output Order

The above code will output:

```
microtask 1
microtask 2
future 1
future 2
```

### Explanation

Microtasks are executed immediately after the current synchronous code block finishes, before
executing any scheduled futures or timers in the event loop. This ensures that microtasks have
priority over other asynchronous tasks.

### 29. Flutter `Future` vs `Completer`

#### `Future`

- **Definition:** Represents a delayed computation or result that will be available in the future.
- **Usage:** Used to retrieve results from asynchronous operations.

#### `Completer`

- **Definition:** A way to create and control a `Future` manually.
- **Usage:** Allows you to complete a `Future` with a value or an error programmatically.

### Example

```dart
void main() {
  // Example Future usage
  Future<int> fetchData() {
    return Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2), () => 42);
  }

  fetchData().then((value) => print('Fetched data: $value'));

  // Example Completer usage
  Completer<int> completer = Completer<int>();

  fetchDataWithCompleter(completer);

  completer.future.then((value) => print('Completed with completer: $value'));
}

void fetchDataWithCompleter(Completer<int> completer) {
  Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 3), () {
    completer.complete(84);
  });
}
```

### Output

```
Fetched data: 42
Completed with completer: 84
```

In this example, `fetchData` returns a `Future` that completes after a delay,
while `fetchDataWithCompleter` uses a `Completer` to manually complete a `Future`.

### 30. What is an Instance?

- **Definition:** In Dart, an instance refers to a specific object created from a class.
- **Usage:** Instances are created using constructors of the class and represent individual objects
  with their own state and behavior.

### Example

```dart
class MyClass {
  int number;

  MyClass(this.number); // Constructor

  void printNumber() {
    print('Number: $number');
  }
}

void main() {
  MyClass instance = MyClass(42); // Creating an instance of MyClass
  instance.printNumber(); // Output: Number: 42
}
```

### 30. What is `internal`?

- **Definition:** In Dart, `internal` typically denotes members (like constructors or methods) that
  are intended to be private within the library or package scope.
- **Usage:** It restricts access to these members outside the defining library or package.

### Example

```dart
class MyClass {
  // Private constructor
  MyClass._internal();

  factory MyClass() {
    return MyClass._internal();
  }
}
```

In this example, `MyClass._internal()` is a private constructor that can only be accessed within the
same library or package.

### 31. What is `extend`?

- **Definition:** In Dart, the `extends` keyword is used to create a subclass (child class) that
  inherits properties and methods from a superclass (parent class).
- **Usage:** It facilitates class inheritance, allowing the subclass to extend the functionality of
  the superclass.

### Example

```dart
class Animal {
  void sleep() {
    print('Animal is sleeping');
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  void bark() {
    print('Dog is barking');
  }
}

void main() {
  Dog dog = Dog();
  dog.sleep(); // Output: Animal is sleeping
  dog.bark(); // Output: Dog is barking
}
```

### 32. What is `implement`?

- **Definition:** In Dart, the `implement` keyword is used by a class to promise that it will
  provide implementations for all the methods of an interface.
- **Usage:** It establishes a contract that the implementing class must adhere to.

### Example

```dart
abstract class Animal {
  void eat();
}

class Dog implements Animal {
  @override
  void eat() {
    print('Dog is eating');
  }
}

void main() {
  Dog dog = Dog();
  dog.eat(); // Output: Dog is eating
}
```

In this example, `Dog` implements the `Animal` interface by providing an implementation for
the `eat()` method defined in `Animal`.

### 33. `extends` vs `implements` vs `with`

#### `extends`

- **Usage:** Used for class inheritance.
- **Explanation:** Establishes an 'is-a' relationship between classes, allowing a subclass to
  inherit properties and methods from a superclass.

#### `implements`

- **Usage:** Used to declare that a class will provide specific behavior outlined by an interface.
- **Explanation:** Ensures that the implementing class adheres to the contract defined by the
  interface, implementing all of its methods.

#### `with`

- **Usage:** Used for mixin composition.
- **Explanation:** Incorporates the behavior of a mixin into a class without inheritance, allowing
  code reuse across different class hierarchies.

### Example

```dart
class A {
  void methodA() {}
}

class B extends A {
  // B inherits methodA from A
}

class C implements A {
  @override
  void methodA() {}
}

mixin D {
  void methodD() {}
}

class E with D {
  // E incorporates the behavior of mixin D
}
```

### 34. Is `main()` static or dynamic?

- **Answer:** In Dart, `main()` is a static function.
- **Explanation:** It serves as the entry point of a Dart application and is called by the Dart
  runtime to start the execution of the program.

### 35. What is a Constructor? Types of Constructors in Dart

#### Constructor in Dart

- **Definition:** A special method used for initializing objects when they are created.
- **Types:**
    1. **Default Constructor:** Automatically provided if no custom constructors are defined.
    2. **Named Constructor:** Allows defining multiple constructors with different names.
    3. **Parameterized Constructor:** Accepts parameters to initialize the object's properties.
    4. **Constant Constructor:** Creates a constant object that is immutable.

### Example

```dart
class MyClass {
  int number;

  // Parameterized Constructor
  MyClass(this.number);

  // Named Constructor
  MyClass.fromValue(int value) {
    number = value * 2;
  }

  // Constant Constructor
  const MyClass.constant(this.number);
}

void main() {
  MyClass obj1 = MyClass(42); // Using Parameterized Constructor
  MyClass obj2 = MyClass.fromValue(21); // Using Named Constructor
  const MyClass obj3 = MyClass.constant(10); // Using Constant Constructor
}
```

### 36. What is `fromJson` and `toJson`?

#### `fromJson` and `toJson` in Dart

- **`fromJson`:** Method used to convert JSON (text) into Dart objects.
- **`toJson`:** Method used to convert Dart objects into JSON (text).

### Example

```dart
class User {
  String name;
  int age;

  User(this.name, this.age);

  // Convert JSON to User object
  factory User.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) {
    return User(json['name'], json['age']);
  }

  // Convert User object to JSON
  Map<String, dynamic> toJson() =>
      {
        'name': name,
        'age': age,
      };
}

void main() {
  // JSON to Dart object
  Map<String, dynamic> json = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30};
  User user = User.fromJson(json);

  // Dart object to JSON
  Map<String, dynamic> userJson = user.toJson();
}
```

### 37. What is a Factory?

- **Definition:** In Dart, a `factory` constructor is used to return an instance of a class from a
  method without necessarily creating a new object each time.
- **Usage:** Useful for optimizing object creation or implementing singleton patterns.

### Example

```dart
class Singleton {
  static Singleton _instance;

  factory Singleton() {
    if (_instance == null) {
      _instance = Singleton._internal();
    }
    return _instance;
  }

  Singleton._internal();
}

void main() {
  Singleton singleton1 = Singleton();
  Singleton singleton2 = Singleton();

  print(identical(singleton1, singleton2)); // Output: true
}
```

In this example, `Singleton` class uses a `factory` constructor to ensure only one
instance (`singleton`) is created.

### 38. Override and Overloading in Dart

#### Override

- **Definition:** Replaces a method from a superclass with a new implementation in a subclass.
- **Usage:** Enhances or modifies behavior inherited from the superclass.

#### Overloading

- **Definition:** Not supported in Dart for functions/method

s.

- **Explanation:** In Dart, you cannot have multiple methods with the same name but different
  parameters within the same class. This is because Dart uses optional and named parameters to
  achieve similar functionality without function overloading.

### 39. What is `super` in Dart?

- **Definition:** `super` in Dart refers to the superclass (parent class) of the current subclass (
  child class).
- **Usage:** It allows access to superclass methods and properties from within the subclass.

### Example

```dart
class Animal {
  String name;

  Animal(this.name);

  void speak() {
    print('Animal speaks');
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  Dog(String name) : super(name);

  @override
  void speak() {
    print('Dog barks');
    super.speak(); // Calling superclass method
  }
}

void main() {
  Dog dog = Dog('Buddy');
  dog.speak(); // Outputs: Dog barks\nAnimal speaks
}
```

### 40. What is a Typedef in Dart?

- **Definition:** A `typedef` in Dart is used to provide a name to a function type.
- **Usage:** Simplifies the use of complex function types and enhances code readability.

### Example

```dart
typedef Compare<T> = int Function(T a, T b);

int sort(int a, int b) => a - b;

void main() {
  List<int> numbers = [3, 1, 2];
  numbers.sort(sort); // Using the typedef
  print(numbers); // Output: [1, 2, 3]
}
```

In this example, `typedef` `Compare<T>` is defined as a function type that takes two parameters of
type `T` and returns an `int`. It simplifies the use of the `sort` function in the `List.sort()`
method.

### 41. What are Anonymous Functions?

- **Definition:** In Dart, an anonymous function is a function without a name.
- **Usage:** Used for short, one-time operations where a full function definition is not necessary.

### Example

```dart
void main() {
  // Using an anonymous function
  var addNumbers = (int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
  };

  // Calling the anonymous function
  print(addNumbers(3, 7)); // Output: 10
}
```

In this example, `addNumbers` is an anonymous function that adds two numbers. It's defined and used
right where it's needed.

### 42. Can we send data from a GET request to the server?

- **Answer:** Yes, in a GET request, data can be sent as part of the URL parameters.
- **Limitation:** Typically limited to a maximum length (e.g., 2048 characters) depending on server
  configurations and browser limits.

### Example

```
GET /api/resource?param1=value1&param2=value2
```

### 43. Types of API Methods

- **GET:** Retrieves data of all users or specific resources.
- **POST:** Creates a new user or resource.
- **PUT:** Updates an existing user or resource with the specified ID.
- **PATCH:** Partially updates an existing user or resource.
- **DELETE:** Deletes a user or resource with the specified ID.
- **OPTIONS:** Retrieves supported HTTP methods for a specific endpoint.

### 44. Constant Constructor in Dart

- **Definition:** A constant constructor in Dart creates a constant object whose value cannot be
  changed after initialization.
- **Usage:** Used for objects that are immutable and have constant values.

### Example

```dart
class Circle {
  final double radius;
  static const double pi = 3.14;

  const Circle(this.radius);

  double calculateArea() {
    return pi * radius * radius;
  }
}

void main() {
  const Circle circle = Circle(5.0);
  print('Area of circle: ${circle.calculateArea()}'); // Output: Area of circle: 78.5
}
```

### 45. Sealed Class

- **Definition:** A sealed class restricts the inheritance hierarchy such that all subclasses of the
  sealed class must be declared in the same file where the sealed class is declared.
- **Usage:** It provides a way to define a closed set of possible types, ensuring exhaustive
  handling of all possible cases without allowing extension outside of the defined set.
- **Example:**

```dart
sealed class Result {
  const Result();
}

class Success extends Result {
  final String message;

  Success(this.message);
}

class Failure extends Result {
  final String errorMessage;

  Failure(this.errorMessage);
}
```

In this example, `Result` is a sealed class with `Success` and `Failure` as its subclasses. No other
subclasses can be created outside of this file.

### 46. Immutable and Mutable Class

- **Immutable Class:** An object whose state cannot be modified after it is created. All fields in
  an immutable class should be `final`.
- **Mutable Class:** An object whose state can be modified after it is created, allowing its fields
  to change values.

### 47. Hot Reload vs Hot Restart

- **Hot Reload:** Injects updated source code files into the running Dart Virtual Machine (VM). It
  maintains the app's state and updates the UI almost .
- **Hot Restart:** Restarts the entire app, including the Dart VM. It resets the app's state to its
  initial conditions before reloading the updated UI.

### 48. RefreshIndicator Widget

- **Purpose:** Enables pull-to-refresh functionality in Flutter apps.
- **Usage:** Wraps a scrollable widget (like ListView, GridView) and triggers a refresh action when
  the user pulls down the widget.

### 49. Build Modes in Flutter

Flutter provides three main build modes that determine how the app is compiled and executed. Each
mode serves a different purpose depending on the development or deployment stage.

- **Debug Mode**
    - Debug mode is used during development to enable debugging and rapid iteration. It includes
      debugging tools such as hot reload, asserts, and additional debug symbols to aid in debugging.
      This mode is not optimized for performance and is slower than the other modes due to the
      inclusion
      of debugging features.
    - Command: `flutter run`

- **Profile Mode**
    - Profile mode is designed for performance profiling and benchmarking. It is similar to release
      mode
      but includes additional profiling information for performance analysis. It helps to identify
      performance bottlenecks without the overhead of debugging features. This mode is typically
      used to
      test the app's performance before deploying it to production.
    - Command: `flutter run --profile`

- **Release Mode**
    - Release mode is optimized for production deployment. It disables debugging features, removes
      asserts, and minimizes the size of the application. The app is fully optimized for
      performance,
      making it the fastest mode. This mode is used for final app distribution to end-users through
      app
      stores.
    - Command: `flutter run --release`

Each build mode offers a different balance of debugging features, performance, and app size.

### 50. `NetworkImage` vs `Image.network` in Flutter

- **`NetworkImage`:** A class that represents an image obtained from a URL, used to fetch an image
  programmatically but not directly display it on the screen.
- **`Image.network`:** A widget that displays an image obtained from a URL. It internally
  uses `NetworkImage` to fetch the image and display it on the screen.

### 51. `Navigator.push` and `Navigator.pop` Function

- **`Navigator.push`:** Adds a route to the stack of routes managed by the navigator, navigating to
  a new screen.
- **`Navigator.pop`:** Removes the current route from the stack of routes managed by the navigator,
  returning to the previous screen.

### 52. `double.INFINITY`

- **Usage:** Represents positive infinity in Dart's `double` type.
- **Purpose:** Used to indicate an unbounded or infinitely large value, often in mathematical
  computations or when calculating maximum values.

### 53. Fat Arrow Notation in Dart

- **Syntax:** `=>`
- **Purpose:** Provides a concise syntax for defining short, one-line functions or expressions that
  immediately return a value.
- **Example:** `void function(int a) => print('Value is $a');`

### 54. ScopedModel/BLoC Pattern

- **ScopedModel:** A state management pattern and library that allows passing data down the widget
  tree without rebuilding parent widgets.
- **BLoC (Business Logic Components):** A pattern for managing state and handling data flow using
  streams and reactive programming.

### 55.`BuildContext` in Flutter

- **Definition**  
  `BuildContext` is an immutable object that represents the location of a widget in the widget tree.
  It provides access to the widget's context, which contains information about the widget's position
  and state within the widget hierarchy.

- **Usage**  
  `BuildContext` is used by widgets to:
    - **Access Parent Widgets:** It allows a widget to locate its parent widget in the widget tree,
      which is essential for tasks like navigation and obtaining inherited data.
    - **Access Theme Data:** Widgets can use `BuildContext` to fetch theme data, such as colors,
      text styles, and other UI settings, via `Theme.of(context)`.
    - **Navigate through the Widget Tree:** It enables navigation by providing access to the
      `Navigator` (for pushing or popping routes) and other inherited widgets or services.
    - **Access Inherited Widgets:** `BuildContext` is used to access data from inherited widgets
      like `InheritedWidget` and `Provider` to share data throughout the widget tree.

`BuildContext` is essential for managing the relationship between widgets and their environment,
enabling things like context-based theming and state management.

### 56. `WidgetsApp` vs `MaterialApp` in Flutter

- **`WidgetsApp`:** Provides basic navigation and widget management capabilities without specific
  material design components.
- **`MaterialApp`:** Builds upon `WidgetsApp` by implementing Material Design, offering additional
  widgets and styling for consistent UI across platforms.

### 57. Nesting `Scaffold` in Flutter

- **Feasibility:** Yes, you can nest `Scaffold` widgets.
- **Purpose:** Allows building complex UI structures with multiple layers of material components
  like app bars, drawers, and bottom sheets.

### 58. `SafeArea` Widget in Flutter

- **Purpose:** Ensures that child widgets are positioned within safe areas of device screens,
  avoiding overlap with system UI elements like status bar and notch.

### 59. Method Channel vs Event Channel in Flutter

- **Method Channel:** Used for asynchronous method calls between Flutter and platform-specific
  code (e.g., Android/iOS).
    - the native side and can return back a value and vise versa.You can e.g. call a method that
      retrieves the device name this way.
- **Event Channel:** Used for establishing a data stream from platform-specific code to Flutter,
  providing continuous updates or events.
    - on the *Dart* side of things and being able to feed that stream from the native side.  
      This is useful if you want to send data every time a particular *event* occurs, e.g. when the
      wifi connection of a device changes.

### 63. Android and iOS folders in Flutter Project

- **Android Folder:** Contains the entire Android project necessary for building a Flutter
  application for the Android platform. It includes configurations, resources, and native code
  components specific to Android.

- **iOS Folder:** Contains the entire iOS project necessary for building a Flutter application for
  the iOS platform. It includes configurations, resources, and native code components specific to
  iOS.

### 64. `async`, `await`, `.then()`, `.whenComplete()` and `Future` in Dart

- **`async`:** Keyword used to mark a function as asynchronous, allowing it to use `await`.
- **`await`:** Pauses the execution of a function marked with `async` until a `Future` is complete,
  and then returns the result.
- **`.then((value) { ... })`:** Method called on a `Future` object that registers a callback to be
  executed when the `Future` completes successfully.
- **`.whenComplete(() { ... })`:** Method called on a `Future` object that registers a callback to
  be executed when the `Future` completes, regardless of whether it completes successfully or with
  an error.
- **`Future`:** Represents a value or error that will be available at some point in the future. It
  allows asynchronous operations to be performed and provides a way to retrieve their results.

### 65. FutureBuilder in Flutter

- **Purpose:** Widget used to build UI components based on the state of a `Future`.
- **States:**
    - **Waiting:** Future is ongoing, and data has not yet been received.
    - **Done:** Future has completed successfully, and data is available.
    - **Error:** Future has completed with an error.

### 66. StreamBuilder in Flutter

- **Purpose:** Widget used to build UI components that react to the state of a `Stream`.
- **Usage:** Responds to asynchronous events or updates from a `Stream`, allowing real-time updates
  in the UI based on the stream's state.

### 67. Difference between FutureBuilder and StreamBuilder

**FutureBuilder:**

- Used for handling one-time asynchronous operations, like fetching data from an API.
- Works with a `Future` object.
- Displays UI based on the completion state of a `Future`.

**StreamBuilder:**

- Used for handling continuous asynchronous operations, like real-time data updates.
- Works with a `Stream` object.
- Continuously updates UI based on events received from the stream.

### 68. Channel Socket in Flutter

- **Definition:** Communication channel facilitating real-time data exchange between Flutter
  applications or between Flutter and native platform components.
- **Types:**
    - **Method Channels:** Synchronous communication channels for invoking methods between Flutter
      and native platform.
    - **Stream Channels:** Asynchronous communication channels for streaming data between Flutter
      and native platform.

### 69. Method Channel in Flutter

- **Purpose:** Facilitates synchronous communication between Dart (Flutter) code and
  platform-specific native code (e.g., Android, iOS).
- **Usage:** Enables Flutter applications to access platform-specific features and functionalities.

### 70. MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) Structure

#### Components

1. **Model:**
    - Responsible for managing the applicationâ€™s data and business logic.
    - Handles data fetching, storage, and updates.
    - Does not depend on the View or ViewModel.

2. **View:**
    - Represents the user interface components that users interact with.
    - Displays data provided by the ViewModel.
    - Reacts to user actions and passes them to the ViewModel.

3. **ViewModel:**
    - Acts as a bridge between the Model and the View.
    - Exposes data and commands from the Model to the View in a format that the View can easily use.
    - Maintains the state and logic to process user interactions.
    - Uses binding or other mechanisms to notify the View of changes.

---

#### How it Works

- **View** observes changes in the **ViewModel** and updates the UI accordingly.
- **ViewModel** fetches or manipulates data via the **Model**.
- **Model** provides data or executes business logic when requested by the **ViewModel**.

---

#### Key Features

| **Component** | **Responsibilities**                                                                  | **Example in Flutter**                                                        |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Model**     | Data layer; handles API calls, database operations, or any data processing logic.     | Repository classes or services managing Firebase, REST APIs, or SQLite.       |
| **View**      | UI layer; displays data and responds to user interactions.                            | StatelessWidget or StatefulWidget for screens or widgets.                     |
| **ViewModel** | Mediates between the View and Model; provides processed data and commands for the UI. | ChangeNotifier or Riverpod/Provider to handle state and notify UI of changes. |

---

#### Example in Flutter

```dart
// Model
class User {
  final String name;
  final int age;

  User({required this.name, required this.age});
}

// ViewModel
import 'package:flutter/foundation.dart';

class UserViewModel extends ChangeNotifier {
  late User _user;

  User get user => _user;

  void fetchUser() {
    // Simulating data fetching
    _user = User(name: "John Doe", age: 25);
    notifyListeners();
  }
}

// View
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:provider/provider.dart';

class UserScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final userViewModel = Provider.of<UserViewModel>(context);

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('User Details')),
      body: Center(
        child: userViewModel.user == null
            ? ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () => userViewModel.fetchUser(),
          child: Text('Load User'),
        )
            : Text('Name: ${userViewModel.user.name}, Age: ${userViewModel.user.age}'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(
    ChangeNotifierProvider(
      create: (_) => UserViewModel(),
      child: MaterialApp(home: UserScreen()),
    ),
  );
}
```

---

#### Advantages of MVVM

- **Separation of Concerns:** Clear distinction between UI, business logic, and data.
- **Reusability:** ViewModel can be reused with different Views.
- **Testability:** ViewModel logic can be easily tested without relying on the UI.

#### Disadvantages of MVVM

- **Complexity:** Can be overkill for small applications.
- **Learning Curve:** Requires understanding of bindings and state management tools.

### 71. MVC (Model-View-Controller) Structure

#### Components

1. **Model:**
    - Responsible for managing the applicationâ€™s data and business logic.
    - Handles tasks like fetching, updating, and storing data.
    - Does not interact directly with the View but provides data to the Controller.

2. **View:**
    - Represents the user interface components.
    - Displays data provided by the Model.
    - Captures user interactions and sends them to the Controller.

3. **Controller:**
    - Acts as a mediator between the Model and the View.
    - Handles user input from the View, processes it, and updates the Model.
    - Updates the View when the Model changes.

---

#### How it Works

- **User Interaction:** The user interacts with the **View** (e.g., clicks a button).
- **Controller Action:** The **Controller** interprets the interaction, updates the **Model**, and
  requests the **View** to refresh.
- **Model Updates:** The **Model** changes its state based on the Controllerâ€™s instructions.
- **View Refresh:** The **View** fetches updated data from the **Model** and displays it to the
  user.

---

#### Key Features

| **Component**  | **Responsibilities**                                                           | **Example in Flutter**                                      |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Model**      | Manages data and logic; interacts with APIs, databases, or other data sources. | Repository class handling API calls or database operations. |
| **View**       | Displays data and captures user input; focuses on the user interface.          | StatelessWidget or StatefulWidget widgets.                  |
| **Controller** | Handles user actions and updates both the Model and the View.                  | Methods in a dedicated class or state management logic.     |

---

#### Example in Flutter

```dart
// Model
class Counter {
  int value = 0;

  void increment() => value++;
}

// Controller
class CounterController {
  final Counter counter;

  CounterController(this.counter);

  void incrementCounter() {
    counter.increment();
  }
}

// View
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class CounterView extends StatefulWidget {
  final CounterController controller;

  CounterView(this.controller);

  @override
  _CounterViewState createState() => _CounterViewState();
}

class _CounterViewState extends State<CounterView> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('MVC Counter Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text('Count: ${widget.controller.counter.value}',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24)),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                setState(() {
                  widget.controller.incrementCounter();
                });
              },
              child: Text('Increment'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  final counter = Counter();
  final controller = CounterController(counter);

  runApp(MaterialApp(home: CounterView(controller)));
}
```

---

#### Advantages of MVC

- **Separation of Concerns:** Clearly separates data, UI, and logic.
- **Scalability:** Easy to maintain and extend with additional features.
- **Testability:** Model and Controller can be tested independently.

#### Disadvantages of MVC

- **Complexity:** Adding new features can sometimes require changes in multiple components.
- **Tight Coupling:** The Controller tightly depends on the Model and the View, which can make
  changes more challenging.

### 74. Difference between `async` and `async*` in Dart

- **`async`:**
    - You add the async keyword to a function that does some work that might take a long time. It
      returns the result wrapped in a Future.
    - In Short: async gives you a Future.
    - **Example:**
      ```dart
      Future<int> fetchData() async {
        return 42;
      }
      ```
- **`async*`:**
    - You add the async* keyword to make a function that returns a bunch of future values one at a
      time. The results are wrapped in a Stream.
    - In Short: async* gives you a Stream.
    - **Example:**
      ```dart
      Stream<int> fetchMultipleData() async* {
        yield 1;
        yield 2;
        yield 3;
      }
      ```

### 75. `yield` and `yield*` in Dart

- **`yield`:**
    - yield provides a single value in an Iterable or a Stream.
    - **Example:**
      ```dart
      Iterable<int> generateNumbers() sync* {
        yield 1;
        yield 2;
        yield 3;
      }
      ```
    - The yield statement sends each number into the stream, and the function pauses after each
      yield until itâ€™s called again to fetch the next value.


- **`yield*`:**
    - yield* provides multiple values from another Iterable or Stream.
    - With yield*, you can combine them into one stream or list like this:
    - ** Example:**
        ```dart
        Stream<int> combined() async* {
            yield* Stream.fromIterable([1, 2]);  // Yield all values from the first stream
            yield* Stream.fromIterable([3, 4]);  // Yield all values from the second stream
        }
        ```
    - In this example, the combined stream will emit values 1, 2, 3, 4 in sequence.

### 76. `yield` vs `return` in Dart

- **`yield`:**
    - Returns a value from a generator function and suspends the function's execution.
    - Used for iterative operations that produce a sequence of values.

- **`return`:**
    - Terminates the execution of a function and optionally returns a value.
    - Used to exit from a function once its task is complete.

### 77. Differences between `var`, `final`, and `const` in Dart

- **`var`:**
    - Used for declaring variables with implicit type inference.
    - Allows the variable's value to change.

- **`final`:**
    - Used for declaring variables whose value can be set only once.
    - Typically initialized at runtime and cannot change thereafter.

- **`const`:**
    - Used for declaring compile-time constants whose value is known at compile time.
    - Requires the type to be explicitly specified and remains constant throughout the program.

### 78. Callback Functions and Asynchronous Programming in Dart

- **Callback Function:**
    - A function passed as an argument to another function, to be executed later when a specific
      event or condition occurs.
    - Essential in Dart's asynchronous programming to handle tasks that complete at a later time,
      like fetching data or I/O operations.

### 79. Dependency Injection in Dart

- **Dependency Injection:**
    - A design pattern where objects receive their dependencies from an external source rather than
      creating them internally.
    - Improves modularity, testability, and reusability of code by decoupling dependencies from the
      objects that use them.
    - Implemented in Dart by passing dependencies as parameters manually or using tools/libraries
      like `get_it` or `Provider` in Flutter.

### 80. Built-in Libraries in Dart

1. **`dart:core`:**
    - Includes fundamental classes and utilities for Dart programming.
    - Provides basic data types (e.g., `String`, `List`, `Map`) and core functionalities like
      exception handling and basic operators.

2. **`dart:io`:**
    - Facilitates input and output operations in Dart.
    - Allows interaction with files, directories, and system operations.
    - Essential for building applications that require direct interaction with the device's
      filesystem.

3. **`dart:async`:**
    - Provides classes and utilities for asynchronous programming in Dart.
    - Includes futures, streams, and timers for handling asynchronous tasks.
    - Crucial for managing operations that require non-blocking execution and handling asynchronous
      events.

### 81. Memory Management and Garbage Collection in Dart

- **Memory Management in Dart:**
    - Dart utilizes automatic memory management with a garbage collector.
    - Garbage collection automatically identifies and frees up memory that is no longer in use.
    - Developers do not need to manually allocate or deallocate memory, reducing memory-related
      errors and improving developer productivity.
    - Dart's automatic memory management system ensures efficient memory usage across different
      platforms without requiring manual intervention.

### 84. Types of Tests in Flutter

- **Unit Tests:**
    - Unit tests focus on testing individual pieces of logic, typically functions or methods, in
      isolation. The goal is to verify that a specific unit of code behaves as expected. Unit tests
      are fast, as they don't require a UI or external resources, but they do not replicate the real
      environment, so they might not uncover UI-related issues or integration problems.

  **Example:**
    ```dart
    import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';

    void main() {
      test('Addition test', () {
        expect(2 + 2, 4); // Testing a simple mathematical operation
      });
    }
    ```
  **When to use:** To ensure that specific logic or functions are working as expected.

- **Widget Tests:**
    - Widget tests are used to test individual widgets in isolation. These tests focus on ensuring
      that the widget is rendered correctly, interacts with user input, and behaves as expected when
      part of the appâ€™s UI. Widget tests simulate a UI environment, making them more robust than
      unit tests for UI-related issues.

  **Example:**
    ```dart
    import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
    import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';

    void main() {
      testWidgets('Widget test example', (WidgetTester tester) async {
        // Build the widget
        await tester.pumpWidget(MyWidget());

        // Verify the widget's behavior
        expect(find.text('Hello, World!'), findsOneWidget);  // Check if the widget contains the text
      });
    }
    ```
  **When to use:** To verify that individual widgets are displayed, behave, and interact correctly.

- **Integration Tests:**
    - Integration tests combine unit and widget testing to check how well different parts of the
      application work together. These tests simulate user interactions, connect with databases, and
      validate the flow of data across various components, such as network requests and UI updates.
      They offer a more comprehensive test but can be more complex and slower to run.

  **Example:**
    ```dart
    import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';

    void main() {
      testWidgets('Integration test example', (WidgetTester tester) async {
        // Simulate user interaction and verify that the system behaves as expected.
        await tester.pumpWidget(MyApp());
        
        // Example: Simulate tapping a button and checking the resulting screen
        await tester.tap(find.byIcon(Icons.add));
        await tester.pumpAndSettle();
        
        expect(find.text('Updated Data'), findsOneWidget);
      });
    }
    ```
  **When to use:** To test end-to-end functionality, including interactions between multiple widgets
  and external systems (e.g., APIs, databases).

    - Supports a wide range of SQL features and is suitable for complex applications.

- **Hive:**
    - A lightweight, NoSQL database for Flutter.
    - Offers fast performance and simplicity, ideal for simpler applications or scenarios requiring
      fast data storage and retrieval.

### 92. State Management in Flutter

- **State Management in Flutter:**
    - Facilitates managing and updating the state of widgets in response to user interactions and
      data changes.
    - Popular approaches/libraries include `setState`, `Provider`, `Bloc`, and `GetX`.
    - Each approach offers different levels of complexity and scalability, catering to various app
      architectures and requirements.

### 93. Creating Responsive UI in Flutter

- **Responsive UI Techniques:**
    - **MediaQuery:** Retrieve device size and orientation.
    - **LayoutBuilder:** Construct UI based on parent constraints.
    - **OrientationBuilder:** Adapt UI based on device orientation.
    - **Expanded/Flexible Widgets:** Manage widget sizes dynamically.
    - **Aspect Ratio Widget:** Maintain aspect ratio of child widgets.
    - **Fractionally Sized Box Widgets:** Size widgets as fractions of the available space.
    - **Custom MultiChild Layouts:** Create custom layouts for different screen sizes.

### 94. Tween Animation in Flutter

- **Tween Animation:**
    - Defines the start and end values of an animation.
    - Interpolates between these values over a specified duration.
    - Utilizes the `Tween` class to animate properties such as opacity, position, and size smoothly.

### 95. SizedBox vs Container

- **SizedBox:**
    - Specifies a fixed size for its child widget.
    - Does not provide decoration or styling options like color or padding.

- **Container:**
    - Provides styling, padding, margins, and decoration for its child widget.
    - Offers more control over the appearance of its child widget.

### 96. Runes in Dart

- **Runes:**
    - Represent integer code points of Unicode characters in Dart.
    - Useful for handling characters beyond the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP).
    - Accessed using the `runes` property of the `String` class in Dart.

### 97. Ticker in Flutter

- **Ticker in Flutter:**
    - Manages the timing of animations.
    - Ensures smooth and consistent frame updates.
    - Essential for creating fluid and responsive animations in Flutter applications.

### 98. `MediaQuery` in Flutter

- **Definition:** A widget that provides information about the current media, such as the size,
  orientation, and padding of the screen.
- **Usage:** Allows widgets to adapt their layout and behavior based on the device's screen
  properties.
- **Example:**

```dart

Size screenSize = MediaQuery
    .of(context)
    .size;
double screenWidth = screenSize.width;
double screenHeight = screenSize.height;
```

- **Avoid Unnecessary Rebuilds:** By using `MediaQuery.sizeOf()`, `MediaQuery.paddingOf()`, and
  `MediaQuery.orientationOf()`, your widget will only rebuild when the specific property (size,
  padding, or orientation) changes, leading to better performance.

### 99. What makes Flutter unique?

- **Single Codebase:** Write once, run anywhere. Flutter allows you to write a single codebase that
  works for Android, iOS, web, and desktop apps, saving time and effort in development.

  to create visually appealing and interactive user interfaces.
- **Close-to-Native Performance:** Flutter's architecture and rendering engine enable
  high-performance apps with smooth animations and transitions, providing a native-like experience
  across platforms.
- **No Dependency on Web Browsers:** Unlike some cross-platform frameworks, Flutter doesn't rely on
  web browser technology nor the set of widgets that ship with each device, ensuring consistent
  behavior and appearance across platforms.

### 100. What is tree shaking in Flutter?

- Tree Shaking is the optimization technique for removing the unutilized module in the bundle in the
  build process. It is also the code elimination technique used for optimizing our application.
- Command to run the tree shaking in Flutter:

### 101. Name some famous applications that use Flutter?

- **Google Ads:** Google Ads is a popular advertising platform that uses Flutter for its mobile app.
- **Alibaba:** Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant, uses Flutter for its Xianyu app.
- **Reflectly:** Reflectly, a popular journaling app, is built using Flutter.
- **GPay:** Google Pay, the digital payment platform, uses Flutter for its mobile app development.

### 102. What is the difference between InkWell and GestureDetector ?

- **GestureDetector:**
    - Detects various gestures, such as taps, drags, and swipes, but doesnâ€™t provide any visual
      feedback by default.
    - It only detects gestures on the widget's area, so padding areas or empty spaces wonâ€™t trigger
      interactions. for example, if you have a container with padding and you tap on the padding
      area it won't trigger the gesture.
    - **Example:**
  ```dart
      GestureDetector(
        onTap: () {
          print("Tapped on the widget!");
        },
        child: Container(
          padding: EdgeInsets.all(20),
          color: Colors.blue,
          child: Text("Tap me!"),
        ),
      )
      ```
      
    In this example, the `GestureDetector` will only detect taps on the text or the blue container. The padding area won't trigger the tap event.

- **InkWell:**
    - Provides a material design "ripple" effect when tapped, giving users visual feedback.
    - It makes the entire area of the child widget (including padding) responsive, so any tap on the
      widget, including on the padding, triggers the interaction.
    - **Example:**
  ```dart
      InkWell(
        onTap: () {
          print("Tapped on the widget!");
        },
        child: Container(
          padding: EdgeInsets.all(20),
          color: Colors.blue,
          child: Text("Tap me!"),
        ),
      )
      ```
      

### 103. How does Flutter run the code on Android?

- The engine's C and C++ code are compiled with Android's NDK. The Dart code (both the SDK's and
  yours) are ahead-of-time (AOT) compiled into native, ARM, and x86-64 libraries. Those libraries
  are included in a "runner" Android project, and the whole thing is built into an .apk. When
  launched, the app loads the Flutter library. Any rendering, input, or event handling, and so on,
  is delegated to the compiled Flutter and app code. This is similar to the way many game engines
  work.

During debug mode, Flutter uses a virtual machine (VM) to run its code in order to enable stateful
hot reload, a feature that lets you make changes to your running code without recompilation. You'll
see a "debug" banner in the top right-hand corner of your app when running in this mode, to remind
you that performance is not characteristic of the finished release app.

### 104. How does Flutter run the code on iOS?

- The engine's C and C++ code are compiled with LLVM. The Dart code (both the SDK's and yours) are
  ahead-of-time (AOT) compiled into a native, ARM library. That library is included in a "runner"
  iOS project, and the whole thing is built into an .ipa. When launched, the app loads the Flutter
  library. Any rendering, input or event handling, and so on, are delegated to the compiled Flutter
  and app code. This is similar to the way many game engines work.

During debug mode, Flutter uses a virtual machine (VM) to run its code in order to enable stateful
hot reload, a feature that lets you make changes to your running code without recompilation. You'll
see a "debug" banner in the top right-hand corner of your app when running in this mode, to remind
you that performance is not characteristic of the finished release app.

### 105. What is Inherited Widget and how to use it?

- An `InheritedWidget` in Flutter is like a parent widget that holds some data. It makes that data
  available to all its child widgets (and their descendants) without having to manually pass the
  data down through each widget. This way, any child widget can access the data directly, making it
  easier to manage and update the state in your app, while also improving performance by avoiding
  unnecessary updates.
- To use an `InheritedWidget`, you need to:
    1. Create a class that extends `InheritedWidget` and holds the data you want to share.
    2. Implement the `updateShouldNotify` method to determine when the data has changed.
    3. Wrap your app's root widget with the `InheritedWidget` using the `of` method to access the
       data in any child widget.
- Here's an example of how to use an `InheritedWidget` in Flutter:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

// Step 1: Create an InheritedWidget class
class MyInheritedWidget extends InheritedWidget {
  final String data;

  // Constructor to accept data and the child widget tree
  MyInheritedWidget({required this.data, required Widget child}) : super(child: child);

  // Step 2: A method to access the inherited widget from the context
  static MyInheritedWidget? of(BuildContext context) {
    return context.dependOnInheritedWidgetOfExactType<MyInheritedWidget>();
  }

  // Step 3: Decide when to notify dependents (widgets that depend on this data)
  @override
  bool updateShouldNotify(covariant InheritedWidget oldWidget) {
    return true; // Always notify dependents when data changes
  }
}

// Step 4: Create a widget that uses the inherited data
class MyChildWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Step 5: Access the inherited data using MyInheritedWidget.of(context)
    final inheritedData = MyInheritedWidget
        .of(context)
        ?.data ?? "No Data";

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('InheritedWidget Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Inherited Data: $inheritedData'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Step 6: Wrap the widget tree with the MyInheritedWidget
void main() {
  runApp(
    MyInheritedWidget(
      data: "Hello from InheritedWidget!",
      child: MaterialApp(home: MyChildWidget()),
    ),
  );
}
```

### 106. What is an Event Loop?

The **event loop** is a fundamental part of Dart's concurrency model that manages the execution of
tasks and events in a controlled and orderly fashion. It ensures that asynchronous operations like
callbacks, events, and micro tasks are executed at the right time. The event loop is continuously
running, making sure that the tasks in your Dart program are processed in the correct sequence.

The Dart event loop operates using **two main queues**:

1. **Event Queue:**
    - This queue stores tasks related to **external events** such as user interactions (e.g., mouse
      clicks, button taps), I/O operations, or network responses.
    - The event loop processes the tasks in the event queue **one at a time** after the current task
      finishes.
    - Example: A network request completing and triggering a callback.

2. **Microtask Queue:**
    - This queue is specifically for **short, high-priority tasks** that should run before any
      events in the event queue.
    - These tasks are typically small asynchronous operations or internal actions within your Dart
      code (e.g., `Future.microtask()`).
    - Tasks in the microtask queue are executed **immediately after the currently running code**,
      before processing events in the event queue.

#### How the Event Loop Works:

1. The event loop begins by executing the **synchronous code** (code that runs without waiting for
   external resources) in the main thread.
2. Once all the synchronous code finishes, it starts processing tasks in the **microtask queue**.
3. After the microtasks are completed, it moves on to the **event queue**, processing each event
   sequentially.
4. If there are new microtasks added during the event queue processing, those will be executed
   before the next event is handled.

#### Example:

Consider the following code:

```dart
void main() {
  print('Start');

  // Adding a microtask
  Future.microtask(() {
    print('Microtask 1');
  });

  // Adding a delayed event (event queue)
  Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 1), () {
    print('Event 1');
  });

  // Adding another microtask
  Future.microtask(() {
    print('Microtask 2');
  });

  print('End');
}

// Output:
// Start
// End
// Microtask 1
// Microtask 2
// Event 1
```

### 107. What are Collections?

- In Dart, a collection is an ordered group of items
- **Collections** in Dart are used to store and manage multiple values in a single variable. Dart
  provides several collection types, each with its own characteristics and use cases. The main
  collection types in Dart include:
    - **List:** An ordered collection of elements that allows duplicates.
    - **Set:** An unordered collection of unique elements.
    - **Map:** A collection of key-value pairs where each key is unique.
    - **Queue:** A collection that allows adding and removing elements from both ends.
    - **Runes:** A collection of Unicode code points representing characters.

### 108. Is Dart a statically typed language?

- **Dart** is a **statically typed language**. This means that the type of a variable is known at
  compile time and cannot change during runtime. When you declare a variable in Dart, you specify
  its
  type, and the compiler enforces type checking to ensure that the variable is used correctly
  throughout the program.

### 109. What is the difference between Functions and Methods ?

- Function can be made globally accessible within the app or program.
    - For example: main or print method.
- Method is a function that is associated with an object or class.
    - For example: toString() method in the Object class.

### 110. What is the Difference Between Dependency Injection and Service Locator?

- **Dependency Injection (DI):**
    - **Definition:** A design pattern where objects receive their dependencies from an external
      source rather than creating them internally.
    - **Purpose:** Improves modularity, testability, and reusability of code by decoupling
      dependencies from the objects that use them.
    - **Implementation:** Dependencies are typically passed as parameters to a class's constructor
      or
      methods.
    - **Example:** Constructor injection, method injection, and setter injection are common forms of
      DI.
- **Service Locator:**
    - **Definition:** A design pattern where a central registry or service locator is used to
      provide
      dependencies to classes.
    - **Purpose:** Centralizes the management of dependencies and allows classes to access services
      without knowing their concrete implementations.
    - **Implementation:** Classes request dependencies from the service locator, which resolves and
      provides the required services.
    - **Example:** The `Provider`, `get_it` package in Flutter is an example of a service locator
      that manages
      state and provides dependencies to widgets.

_"Service Locator and Dependency Injection are just implementations of Dependency Inversion
Principle (DIP)."_

Presentation Layer (UI):
This layer deals with user interaction (widgets, state management).

Domain Layer (Business Logic):
The core of your app. It contains entities, business rules, and use cases.

Data Layer (Data Management):
Manages how data is fetched, saved, and updated (APIs, databases).

### 111. What is clean architecture in Flutter?

**Clean Architecture** is a design pattern that helps create apps that are easy to scale, maintain,
and test. It splits the app into different layers, each with its own job, making the app **modular**
and **flexible**. This way, you can add new features, refactor, and test your app without affecting
other parts.

---

#### **Key Layers in Clean Architecture:**

1. **Presentation Layer (UI)**
    - **Responsibility:** Manages user interaction and UI components.
    - **Components:**
        - **Pages:** Screens (e.g., `HomePage`, `LoginPage`).
        - **Widgets:** Reusable UI elements (e.g., buttons, cards).
        - **State Management:** (e.g., `Cubit`, `Bloc`, `Provider`).

2. **Domain Layer (Business Logic)**
    - **Responsibility:** Contains core app logic, free from framework dependencies.
    - **Components:**
        - **Entities:** Core data models (e.g., `User`, `Todo`).
        - **Use Cases:** Business rules (e.g., `GetTodos`, `AddTodo`).
        - **Repositories (Interfaces):** Defines contracts for data access, abstracting the data
          layer.

3. **Data Layer (Data Management)**
    - **Responsibility:** Manages data handling, including fetching, saving, and updating data.
    - **Components:**
        - **Datasources:** APIs, databases, local storage.
        - **Repositories (Implementations):** Concrete data access methods.
        - **Mappers:** Convert data models to domain entities and vice versa.

4. **Core Layer (Shared Utilities)**
    - **Responsibility:** Provides shared functionalities across the app.
    - **Components:**
        - **Utils:** Helpers (e.g., formatters, validators).
        - **Exceptions:** Custom exceptions (e.g., `NetworkException`).
        - **Constants:** Shared constants (e.g., API URLs, color schemes).

---

### **Folder Structure Example:**

```
lib/
â”œâ”€â”€ presentation/      # UI Layer
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pages/         # Screens (e.g., HomePage, LoginPage)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ widgets/       # Reusable widgets (e.g., buttons, cards)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ blocs/         # State management (Cubit/Bloc/ViewModel/Controller)
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ domain/            # Business Logic Layer
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ entities/      # Core models (e.g., Todo, User)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ usecases/      # Business logic (e.g., GetTodos, AddTodo)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ repositories/  # Data access contracts
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ data/              # Data Management Layer
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ datasources/   # APIs, databases, local storage
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ repositories/  # Data access implementations
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ mappers/       # Data to entity conversion
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ core/              # Shared utilities
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ utils/         # Helpers (e.g., formatters)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ exceptions/    # Custom exceptions
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ constants/     # Shared constants
```

#### **How it's works:**

- The UI (Presentation) talks to the business logic (Domain) to perform tasks.
- The Domain layer calls the Data layer to get or send data.
- The Data layer fetches data from APIs, databases, or other sources and returns it to the Domain
  layer.
- Each layer is independent and doesn't depend on the others, making it easy to test, maintain, and
  scale.

### 112. mvc vs mvvm vs clean architecture.

- Choosing the right architecture for your Android project depends on various factors such as
  project size, complexity.
    - While MVC and MVP are suitable for
      smaller projects,
    - MVVM, Clean Architecture, and MVI offer better scalability, testability, and
      maintainability for larger and more complex projects.

### 113. Dart DevTools

- Dart DevTools is a suite of tools for debugging and profiling Flutter apps, offering
  insights into your app's performance, memory usage, and state management. It helps you visualize
  what's happening inside your app, making it easier to identify issues and optimize performance.

![img_3.png](img_3.png)

- **Debugger:** Allows you to pause the app, inspect variables, step through the code, and find bugs
  more easily.
- **Logging View:** Displays logs and error messages from your app to help track down issues and
  understand app behavior.
- **App Size Tool:** Helps you analyze the size of your app, identifying large assets or
  dependencies that may increase the app size.
- **CPU Profiler:** Visualizes CPU usage and performance, helping you identify parts of your code
  that are using excessive CPU time.
- **Memory View:** Monitors memory usage to detect memory leaks and optimize memory management in
  your app.
- **Network View:** Tracks network requests and responses, allowing you to monitor API calls and
  data flow in your app.
- **Performance View:** Shows real-time frame rendering performance, helping you detect rendering
  issues or performance bottlenecks.
- **Flutter Inspector:** Displays the widget tree and allows you to inspect widget properties and
  layout issues directly within the app.

### 114. Navigator in Flutter (Navigator 1.0 vs Navigator 2.0).

| Feature                      | **Navigator 1.0 (Imperative API)**                                              | **Navigator 2.0 (Declarative API)**                                                               |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Usage**                    | Direct manipulation using methods like `push()`, `pop()`.                       | Describes routes and state declaratively via `RouterDelegate`.                                    |
| **Control Type**             | Imperative, i.e., direct changes in navigation stack.                           | Declarative, i.e., UI responds to state changes.                                                  |
| **Navigation Flow**          | Manual control, changes made explicitly in code.                                | Driven by app state, with the UI reflecting route changes.                                        |
| **Complexity**               | Simpler for small apps; gets complex with deep links, nested routes.            | Handles complex scenarios (deep links, nested navigation) easily.                                 |
| **Deep Linking**             | Harder to implement. Requires manual handling of deep links.                    | Built-in support for deep linking and URL-based navigation.                                       |
| **State Management**         | Requires external management tools or manual updates.                           | Navigation state is tied to app state, simplifying state management.                              |
| **URL Support**              | No built-in support for URL-based navigation.                                   | URL-based navigation is built-in and easier to implement.                                         |
| **Back Navigation Handling** | Handled manually, based on the `Navigator` stack.                               | Customizable through `RouterDelegate` and state management.                                       |
| **Route Management**         | Routes managed via `push()` and `pop()` calls.                                  | Routes are tied to appâ€™s state, managed by the routerâ€™s delegate.                                 |
| **Example Usage**            | `Navigator.push(context, MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => NextPage()));` | `Router(routerDelegate: MyRouterDelegate(), routeInformationParser: MyRouteInformationParser());` |

**Summary:**

- **Navigator 1.0** is simpler for small apps and involves direct manipulation of the navigation
  stack. However, it becomes complex for apps requiring deep linking or nested navigation.
- **Navigator 2.0** offers a more flexible, declarative approach, making it ideal for larger apps
  with complex navigation requirements like URL-based navigation, deep linking, and state-driven
  navigation.

### 114. What is layout builder in Flutter?

- `LayoutBuilder` is a Flutter widget that helps you create flexible layouts. It gives you access to
  the size and constraints of the parent widget, so you can build UI elements that adjust
  automatically based on the available space. This makes it easy to create responsive designs that
  adapt to different screen sizes.

### 115. What are the similarities and differences between extension, mixin, and abstract class?

**Extensions**, **Mixins**, and **Abstract Classes** are all features in Dart that allow you to add
or modify functionality in classes.

#### **Differences:**

| Feature                  | **Extension**                                                                            | **Mixin**                                                               | **Abstract Class**                                                                             |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**              | Adds new functionality to an existing class without modifying it directly.               | Allows multiple classes to share common functionality.                  | Provides a blueprint for other classes, requiring them to implement certain methods.           |
| **Usage**                | Used to extend the functionality of an existing class or type.                           | Used to share common functionality across multiple classes.             | Used as a base class that can't be instantiated and needs subclasses to implement methods.     |
| **Multiple Inheritance** | Can be applied to a class to add functionality, but a class can only have one extension. | Can be mixed into many classes simultaneously.                          | Can't be mixed into multiple classes, but can have multiple subclasses.                        |
| **Inheritance**          | Doesn't require inheritance. It adds methods/properties to existing classes.             | Doesn't create a new class; adds shared behavior to other classes.      | Must be extended by subclasses, which must implement its abstract methods.                     |
| **Abstract Methods**     | Cannot have abstract methods. It only provides additional methods.                       | Can contain implemented methods. No requirement for abstract methods.   | Can contain abstract methods (methods without implementations) that subclasses must implement. |
| **Instance Creation**    | Can't create instances of an extension.                                                  | Can't create instances of a mixin directly. Only used in other classes. | Can't create instances of an abstract class. Only used as a base class.                        |

#### **When to Use Each:**

- **Extension**: Use when you want to add functionality to an existing class or library without
  modifying the original code.
- **Mixin**: Use when you need to share common behavior across multiple classes but donâ€™t need to
  create a new class.
- **Abstract Class**: Use when you want to define a common interface for other classes to follow,
  but you donâ€™t want the abstract class to be instantiated.

### 116. What are the three types of trees in Flutter?

1. **Widget Tree**:
    - This is the blueprint of your app's UI. It contains all the widgets (like buttons, text, and
      images) that define how your app looks.
    - **Example**: If you have a `Text` widget that says "Hello," it will be part of the widget
      tree.

2. **Element Tree**:
    - This tree manages the actual state of the widgets at runtime. It keeps track of the widgets'
      behavior and updates when needed.
    - **Example**: When you press a button, the element tree helps track the state change (like
      changing color or text).

3. **Render Object Tree**:
    - This tree is responsible for the actual layout and drawing of the widgets on the screen. It
      determines how the widgets should be sized and positioned.
    - **Example**: It decides the exact position and size of the "Hello" text on the screen.

In short:

- **Widget Tree** = Describes what the app looks like.
- **Element Tree** = Manages the behavior and state of widgets.
- **Render Object Tree** = Handles the layout and drawing of the UI on the screen.

### 117. What is the use of â€˜freezedâ€™ and â€˜json_serializableâ€™ in flutter?

- **Freezed:**
    - Used for creating immutable data classes, handling equality, copying, and creating sealed
      classes.
    - freezed provides an immutable class with built-in methods like copyWith, ==, and hashCode..
- **json_serializable:**
    - Used for automating the conversion between JSON and Dart objects (serialization and
      deserialization).
    - json_serializable automatically generates the fromJson() and toJson() methods to convert
      between User objects and JSON.

### 118. What are the navigation methods and what is the difference between them?

- **Navigation Methods in Flutter:**
    - **Navigator.push():** Pushes a new route onto the navigator stack.
    - **Navigator.pop():** Pops the current route off the navigator stack.
    - **Navigator.pushReplacement():** Replaces the current route with a new route.
    - **Navigator.pushNamed():** Pushes a named route onto the navigator stack.
    - **Navigator.popUntil():** Pops routes off the stack until a given predicate is true.
    - **Navigator.pushAndRemoveUntil():** Pushes a new route and removes all previous routes until a
      given predicate is true.

### 119. How to pass values in between flutter screens?

- **Navigator.push (Imperative)**: Pass data via the constructor when navigating to a new screen.
    - Example:
      `Navigator.push(context, MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => SecondScreen(data: 'Hello')));`

- **Navigator.pushNamed (Named Routes)**: Pass data using route arguments in named routes.
    - Example: `Navigator.pushNamed(context, '/second', arguments: 'Hello');`

- **Provider (State Management)**: Share data across multiple screens using a state management
  solution like `Provider`.
    - Example: `context.read<DataProvider>().updateData('New Data');`

- **ModalRoute (Dialogs)**: Pass data with dialogs or modal popups using route settings.
    - Example: `ModalRoute.of(context)?.settings.arguments;`

### 120. What are they ??, ??=, ?., â€¦? in Dart?

- ??: Used for null checking and providing default values.
- ??=: Assigns a value only if the variable is null.
- ?.: Safely accesses members of an object if the object is not null.
- ...?: Spreads elements of an iterable, skipping null values.

### 121. What is Dart runtime?

- Dart runtime refers to the environment where Dart code is executed.
  The Dart runtime is responsible for interpreting or compiling Dart code into machine code that can
  be executed by the target platform.

### 122. What is Dart VM?

- The Dart VM (Virtual Machine) is a runtime environment that executes Dart code. It is responsible
  for running Dart programs, whether they're running as a command-line tool, a web server, or a
  Flutter app. The Dart VM provides features like Just-in-Time (JIT) compilation and garbage
  collection to efficiently execute Dart code.

### 123. Differences between streams and sockets in Flutter?

- Sockets is a real time technology related to server side which enables your back-end to push data
  to your client side without the need for continuous polling your server.

- Streams in flutter is an object that hold reference to changing data that you can tap into it and
  react to the change.

### 124. Differences between the navigator and router in Flutter?

- **Routing** is the process of defining and mapping routes (URLs) to specific screens or views in
  your app.
- **Navigation** is the action of moving between these screens or views by transitioning from one
  route to another.

### 125. MQTT vs WebSockets in Flutter?

- **MQTT**: Great for low-power devices and situations with slow or unstable internet. It works well
  for sending small messages, often used in IoT (like sensors or smart devices).

- **WebSocket**: Best for real-time communication, like chats or live updates. It needs a stable
  connection and uses more resources than MQTT.

#### **Key Differences**

| **Aspect**             | **MQTT**                              | **WebSocket**                             |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Communication**      | Sends messages from clients to topics | Two-way communication (client and server) |
| **Use Case**           | IoT, smart devices, sensors           | Chat apps, live notifications, updates    |
| **Reliability**        | Ensures message delivery              | No guaranteed message delivery            |
| **Server Requirement** | Needs an MQTT server                  | No server needed (direct connection)      |

---

#### **Summary**

- **MQTT** is best for low-power, low-bandwidth devices like sensors or IoT devices.
- **WebSocket** is better for apps needing real-time updates, like messaging or live tracking. *
  *WebSockets** are suited for real-time, two-way communication apps, requiring a stable connection
  and providing low-latency communication for continuous data exchange.

### 126. Time Complexity vs Space Complexity in Flutter?

#### **Time Complexity**:

- **What it means**: How much time an operation takes as data size increases.
- **In Flutter**: For example, searching or sorting a large list. The more items, the more time it
  takes.

#### **Space Complexity**:

- **What it means**: How much memory an operation uses as data size increases.
- **In Flutter**: Storing data like images or videos. More items mean more memory usage.

---

#### **In Simple Terms**:

- **Time Complexity**: How fast your app runs.
- **Space Complexity**: How much memory your app uses.

#### **Summary**:

- **Time Complexity**: Matters when you want your app to be fast.
- **Space Complexity**: Matters when you need to manage memory, especially on devices with limited
  resources.

If an interviewer asks, "Which one would you prioritizeâ€”time complexity or space complexity?", your
answer should depend on the context of the app you're developing.

If an interviewer asks, **"Which one would you prioritizeâ€”time complexity or space complexity?"**,
your answer should depend on the context of the app you're developing. Hereâ€™s a simple way to
respond:

#### **Answer Example**:

"It depends on the specific needs of the app:

- **If speed is critical**, like in apps that process or display large amounts of data (e.g.,
  sorting lists, searching), **time complexity** would be a priority. Iâ€™d focus on optimizing the
  code to ensure fast execution.

- **If the app has limited memory** (e.g., running on devices with low resources or dealing with
  large media like images and videos), **space complexity** becomes more important. I would optimize
  memory usage to prevent crashes or slowdowns.

#### Key Considerations:

- For apps that **require real-time updates** (like messaging or live feeds), focus on **time
  complexity**.
- For apps that handle **media content** (like photo or video apps), **space complexity** is crucial
  to manage memory effectively.
